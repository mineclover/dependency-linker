# Current Project Status - Feature 005 Test Optimization

## Current Branch: 005-

## Test Optimization Phase Status
- **Current State**: 309 tests with 23 failures, 3.17s execution time
- **Target Goals**: ~250 tests, <1.5s execution, >99% pass rate
- **Key Issues**: Parser registration warnings, flaky tests, complex setup/teardown

## Modified Files
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated project context
- `jest.config.js` - Enhanced test configuration
- `package.json` - Updated scripts and dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency updates

## Architecture Status
- **Core Framework**: Stable and functional
- **CLI Interface**: Working with new optimization commands
- **API Interface**: Fully functional
- **Plugin System**: Stable
- **Caching**: Multi-tier system operational

## Next Steps
- Complete test optimization implementation
- Reduce test count from 309 to ~250
- Improve test execution time to <1.5s
- Achieve >99% test pass rate
- Consolidate duplicate tests
- Optimize parser registry initialization

## Performance Targets
- Test execution: <1.5s (currently 3.17s)
- Test reliability: >99% (currently ~92.6%)
- Memory usage: Optimized worker management
- Test count: ~250 (currently 309)
