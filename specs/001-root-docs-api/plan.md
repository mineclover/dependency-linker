# Implementation Plan: Documentation Improvement and Restructuring

**Branch**: `001-root-docs-api` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/junwoobang/project/dependency-linker/specs/001-root-docs-api/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature focuses on improving the project's documentation by restructuring it into a new `docs/` directory, updating the content, and documenting the core logic based on an analysis of the test code.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0.0
**Primary Dependencies**: tree-sitter, tree-sitter-typescript
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Jest
**Target Platform**: Node.js
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: The scope is limited to the documentation of the existing codebase.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (core library)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed: `dependency-linker` - Analyzes and manages dependencies in TypeScript projects.
- CLI per library: `analyze-file`
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? No

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes, via `logger.ts`
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes, via `ErrorReporter.ts`

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? No
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Identify Markdown files in the root directory**: List all `.md` files in the root and decide which ones are documentation to be moved.
2. **Analyze test files**: Examine the `tests/` directory to understand the core logic and architecture.
3. **Analyze API and CLI integration**: Review `src/api/`, `src/cli/`, and `analyze-file` to understand the public-facing interfaces.

**Output**: `research.md` with the analysis of the codebase.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1.  **Define Documentation Structure**: Create a new `docs/` directory and define the structure of the documentation within it.
2.  **Create initial documentation files**: Create placeholder files in the `docs/` directory.
3.  **No new contracts**: This feature is about documentation, so no new API contracts will be created.
4.  **Update quickstart.md**: The `quickstart.md` will be updated to reflect the new documentation structure.

**Output**: `docs/` directory with initial documentation structure, updated `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create tasks for moving each identified documentation file from the root to the `docs/` directory.
- Create tasks for updating the content of each moved document.
- Create a task for creating a new document that explains the core logic based on the research from Phase 0.
- Create a task to update `README.md` to point to the new `docs/` directory.

**Ordering Strategy**:
1.  Create `docs/` directory.
2.  Move files.
3.  Update `README.md`.
4.  Update moved files.
5.  Create new documentation files.

**Estimated Output**: 5-10 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

**Gate Status**:
- [X] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
