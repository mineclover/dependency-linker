# Feature Specification: Documentation Improvement and Restructuring

**Feature Branch**: `001-root-docs-api`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The documentation needs to be improved. Check if all the documents in the root are up-to-date, and move them to `docs/`. Analyze the API and CLI integration to see if it's enough to just explain the core. Then, document the structure of the core logic based on the test code."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new developer joining the project, I want to have clear, up-to-date, and well-structured documentation so that I can quickly understand the project's architecture, APIs, and core logic.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new developer, **When** I look for documentation, **Then** I find a `docs/` directory with all relevant project documentation.
2. **Given** I read the documentation, **When** I look for information about the core logic, **Then** I find a clear explanation of its structure and components, based on the existing tests.
3. **Given** I am looking at the root directory, **When** I check for documentation files, **Then** I find them moved to the `docs/` directory.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a document in the root is not a documentation file? It should be left in the root.
- What happens if the test code is not clear enough to document the core logic? The source code will be analyzed directly to supplement the documentation.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST have a `docs/` directory containing all project documentation.
- **FR-002**: All Markdown files from the root directory (excluding README.md) that are project documentation MUST be moved to the `docs/` directory.
- **FR-003**: The documentation in the `docs/` directory MUST be verified and updated to be current.
- **FR-004**: The documentation MUST include an analysis of the API and CLI integration to determine if documenting only the core is sufficient.
- **FR-005**: The documentation MUST describe the structure and components of the core logic.
- **FR-006**: The documentation of the core logic MUST be based on the existing test code. If the test code is insufficient, the source code will be analyzed directly.
- **FR-007**: The root directory MUST NOT contain project documentation files after the move, with the exception of README.md.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation**: The collection of all documents explaining the project.
- **Core Logic**: The central part of the application's architecture.
- **API/CLI Integration**: The way the API and CLI parts of the application interact.
