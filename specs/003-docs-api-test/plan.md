# Implementation Plan: API Test Coverage Enhancement

**Branch**: `003-docs-api-test` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-docs-api-test/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   ✅ Feature spec loaded - test coverage enhancement for API methods
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   ✅ Project type: single TypeScript library with Jest testing
   ✅ Structure Decision: Option 1 (single project) - existing test structure
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   ✅ Testing-focused project - aligns with constitutional requirements
   ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ✅ Research existing test patterns and coverage gaps
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Achieve comprehensive test coverage for untested API methods, focusing on diagnostic methods (9 methods), factory cache functions (3 functions), adaptive concurrency logic, resource monitoring, and directory analysis edge cases. Technical approach emphasizes incremental implementation with functional validation rather than exhaustive coverage metrics.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with Node.js  
**Primary Dependencies**: Jest (testing), tree-sitter (AST parsing), tree-sitter-typescript  
**Storage**: File system based analysis, no persistent storage  
**Testing**: Jest with ts-jest, existing test structure (contract/integration/unit/performance)  
**Target Platform**: Node.js library with CLI interface  
**Project Type**: single - TypeScript library with established test infrastructure  
**Performance Goals**: Tests should execute in <5 seconds per test file, maintain existing performance  
**Constraints**: Use existing Jest configuration, follow established test patterns, 단계별로 구현하고 테스트는 기능이 동작하는지 정도로 러프하게 측정하는 방향으로  
**Scale/Scope**: 22 total API methods, targeting 9 diagnostic methods + 3 cache functions + edge cases

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (library with comprehensive test suite)
- Using framework directly? Yes - Jest testing framework used directly
- Single data model? Yes - test scenarios and coverage metrics as data
- Avoiding patterns? Yes - no unnecessary abstraction layers for testing

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A - this IS a testing enhancement for existing library
- Libraries listed: dependency-linker (core library being tested)
- CLI per library: Existing CLI maintained, diagnostic CLI available
- Library docs: Will update documentation as part of testing validation

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES - tests will be written first, verified to fail, then implementation fixed
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES - test files created before any code changes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Modified for testing project - Unit tests for untested methods first
- Real dependencies used? YES - actual file system, memory monitoring, real async operations
- Integration tests for: new test files, contract changes, shared test utilities
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES - test output structured, diagnostic methods include logging validation
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A - library project
- Error context sufficient? YES - test failures will include full context

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Current: 1.0.0, will increment BUILD on test additions
- BUILD increments on every change? YES - patch version updates
- Breaking changes handled? N/A - adding tests, no breaking API changes

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project structure maintained, adding new test files to existing test hierarchy

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

No unknowns detected in Technical Context - all testing technologies and approaches are established:

1. **Jest Testing Framework**: Well-established, existing configuration available
2. **TypeScript Support**: ts-jest already configured  
3. **Test Structure**: Existing patterns in unit/integration/contract structure
4. **API Methods**: Clearly documented in gaps analysis document
5. **Performance Requirements**: Existing performance test patterns available

**Research Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Analysis of existing test patterns in `/tests/unit/api/` directory
- ✅ Review of Jest configuration and testing infrastructure  
- ✅ Identification of untested methods from coverage gaps analysis
- ✅ Assessment of memory monitoring and resource management test approaches

**Output**: research.md with consolidated findings on test implementation approach

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete ✅*

**Artifacts Created**:
1. **data-model.md** - Comprehensive data model for test entities:
   - TestSuite, TestCase, TestScenario structures
   - CoverageMetric and ResourceMonitoringScenario definitions
   - Entity relationships and validation rules
   
2. **API Contracts** in `/contracts/` directory:
   - `diagnostic-methods.contract.ts` - 9 diagnostic method interfaces and test scenarios
   - `factory-cache.contract.ts` - 3 cache management function contracts
   - `batch-adaptive.contract.ts` - Adaptive concurrency and resource management contracts  
   - `directory-edge-cases.contract.ts` - Directory analysis edge case contracts
   
3. **quickstart.md** - Comprehensive validation guide:
   - Step-by-step testing procedures
   - Performance validation criteria  
   - Troubleshooting guide and success criteria

**Design Decisions**:
- Four focused test files rather than monolithic test suite
- Memory monitoring using native Node.js capabilities  
- Functional validation approach (단계별로 구현하고 테스트는 기능이 동작하는지 정도로 러프하게 측정하는 방향으로)
- Integration with existing Jest infrastructure

**Output**: Complete design artifacts with failing test contracts ready for implementation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load design artifacts (contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md)  
- Generate implementation tasks based on contract specifications
- Each contract interface → test implementation task [P]
- Each test scenario → test case creation task [P]
- Validation tasks derived from quickstart scenarios

**Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation Tasks** - Basic test file setup and structure
2. **Method Testing Tasks** - Individual API method test implementation  
3. **Scenario Testing Tasks** - Complex scenario and edge case testing
4. **Integration Tasks** - Performance validation and CI/CD integration
5. **Documentation Tasks** - Test documentation and maintenance guides

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before any code changes
- Dependency order: Foundation → Individual methods → Scenarios → Integration
- Parallel execution: Mark independent test files with [P] for parallel development

**Estimated Task Count**: 28-35 tasks organized as:
- 4 foundation tasks (test file setup) [P]
- 15 method testing tasks (9 diagnostic + 3 cache + 3 adaptive) [P]
- 8 scenario testing tasks (edge cases, resource monitoring) 
- 4 integration tasks (performance, coverage, CI/CD)
- 3 documentation tasks (patterns, maintenance, troubleshooting)

**Quality Gates**: Each task includes:
- RED phase: Test must fail initially
- GREEN phase: Implementation makes test pass
- REFACTOR phase: Optimize and clean up
- VALIDATION: Meets performance and integration criteria

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run quickstart.md scenarios, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - testing enhancement aligns with TDD principles*

**Justified Design Decisions**:
- Four test files instead of one: Better organization, parallel execution, maintainability
- Functional validation approach: Matches user requirement for rough measurement vs exhaustive metrics
- Integration with existing Jest: Maintains consistency, leverages established patterns

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
