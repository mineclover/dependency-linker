# Feature Specification: API Test Coverage Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `003-docs-api-test`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "docs/api/test-coverage-gaps.md | 0<\ ä„¬À| ©qÜ¤"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature focuses on test coverage improvement based on gaps analysis
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: test engineers (actors), test creation/enhancement (actions), API methods and edge cases (data), existing test infrastructure (constraints)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clearly defined in coverage gaps document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Test-focused scenarios with clear verification criteria
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focuses on specific test coverage areas
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Test files, coverage metrics, API methods
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec focuses on testing infrastructure improvements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a test engineer, I want to achieve comprehensive test coverage for all API methods and edge cases identified in the gaps analysis, so that the codebase has reliable quality assurance and production issues are prevented.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current API test suite with 59% method coverage, **When** I run the enhanced test suite, **Then** diagnostic methods achieve 100% test coverage
2. **Given** untested factory cache management functions, **When** I execute cache-related tests, **Then** all three cache functions are validated with proper state management
3. **Given** complex BatchAnalyzer logic without tests, **When** I run adaptive concurrency tests, **Then** memory-based throttling scenarios are verified at 60%, 80%, 90%, and 95% thresholds
4. **Given** directory analysis edge cases, **When** I test complex ignore patterns and symlink handling, **Then** all platform-specific behaviors are validated

### Edge Cases
- What happens when memory thresholds trigger garbage collection during batch processing?
- How does the system handle early termination conditions in processing strategies?
- What occurs when diagnostic methods encounter system resource constraints?
- How do factory cache functions behave under concurrent access scenarios?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide test coverage for all 9 diagnostic and debug methods in TypeScriptAnalyzer class
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all 3 factory cache management functions with proper state verification
- **FR-003**: System MUST test adaptive concurrency logic with memory usage ratios at critical thresholds (60%, 80%, 90%, 95%)
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify resource monitoring and throttling mechanisms including garbage collection triggers
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate processing strategy selection algorithms and error rate threshold behaviors
- **FR-006**: System MUST test directory analysis edge cases including complex ignore patterns and symlink handling
- **FR-007**: System MUST verify batch callback functionality including onProgress, onFileError, and onFileComplete callbacks
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate configuration edge cases with various option combinations and format variations
- **FR-009**: System MUST achieve measurable improvement in overall API test coverage from current baseline
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all new tests are maintainable and follow existing test patterns

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Suites**: Collections of tests organized by functionality (diagnostic, factory cache, batch adaptive, directory edge cases)
- **Coverage Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of test coverage including method coverage percentages and risk assessments  
- **API Methods**: Specific functions requiring test coverage including diagnostic methods, cache functions, and batch processing logic
- **Test Scenarios**: Specific test cases covering normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Configuration Options**: Various API configuration parameters that need validation across different combinations
