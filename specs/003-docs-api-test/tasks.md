# Tasks: API Test Coverage Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-docs-api-test/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ✓ Implementation plan loaded - TypeScript + Jest testing
   ✓ Extract: TypeScript 5.0+, Jest, ts-jest, existing test structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ✓ data-model.md: TestSuite, TestCase, CoverageMetric entities
   ✓ contracts/: 4 contract files → 4 contract test tasks
   ✓ research.md: Jest patterns, memory monitoring approach
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ✓ Setup: test file structure, validation setup
   ✓ Tests: contract tests for 4 API areas, integration scenarios
   ✓ Core: N/A - testing existing API methods
   ✓ Integration: coverage reporting, performance validation
   ✓ Polish: documentation, maintenance guides
4. Apply task rules:
   ✓ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ✓ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ✓ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ✓ All contracts have tests? YES
   ✓ All entities covered? YES
   ✓ All validation scenarios included? YES
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) before all other tasks
- Contract tests (T005-T026) before implementation (T027-T045)
- Implementation before integration (T046-T051)
- Integration before polish (T052-T059)

**Critical Dependencies**:
- T027-T035 depend on T005-T013 (diagnostic methods tests must fail first)
- T036-T038 depend on T014-T016 (factory cache tests must fail first)  
- T039-T041 depend on T017-T022 (adaptive tests must fail first)
- T042-T045 depend on T023-T026 (directory tests must fail first)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Commit after each task completion
- All new test files follow existing Jest patterns
- Memory monitoring uses Node.js native capabilities
- Functional validation approach (단계별로 구현하고 테스트는 기능이 동작하는지 정도로 러프하게 측정하는 방향으로)

## Task Generation Rules Applied
*Applied during execution*

1. **From Contracts**: 4 contract files → 22 contract test tasks [P]
2. **From Data Model**: TestSuite, TestCase entities → test utility tasks [P]  
3. **From User Stories**: Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks
4. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Implementation → Integration → Polish
5. **Parallel Marking**: Different files marked [P], same file sequential

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (4 contracts → 22 contract tests)
- [x] All entities have supporting tasks (test utilities created)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T005-T026 before T027-T045)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files marked [P])
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path (all tasks have specific paths)
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (validated)

## Success Metrics
- **Coverage Improvement**: Diagnostic methods 0% → 100%, Factory cache 0% → 100%
- **Test Execution**: All test files complete in <5 seconds
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Jest infrastructure
- **Validation**: All quickstart scenarios pass successfully
