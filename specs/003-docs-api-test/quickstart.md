# Quickstart: API Test Coverage Enhancement

## Overview
This quickstart guide validates the implementation of comprehensive test coverage for previously untested API methods. Follow these steps to verify that the test enhancement feature works correctly.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Project dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- Jest testing framework configured
- Access to project root directory

## Quick Validation (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Baseline Coverage
```bash
# Check current test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Expected: Coverage report showing gaps in TypeScriptAnalyzer methods
```

### Step 2: Run New Test Suites
```bash  
# Run diagnostic methods tests
npm test -- tests/unit/api/diagnostic-methods.test.ts

# Run factory cache tests  
npm test -- tests/unit/api/factory-cache.test.ts

# Run adaptive batch processing tests
npm test -- tests/unit/api/batch-adaptive.test.ts

# Run directory edge cases tests
npm test -- tests/unit/api/directory-edge-cases.test.ts
```

**Expected Results**:
- All tests pass with green status
- No test execution errors
- Each test file completes in <5 seconds

### Step 3: Validate Coverage Improvement
```bash
# Generate updated coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Compare against baseline
```

**Expected Improvements**:
- TypeScriptAnalyzer method coverage: 59% → 80%+
- Factory functions coverage: 75% → 100%
- BatchAnalyzer coverage: ~60% → 80%+

## Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Diagnostic Methods Validation

#### Test Debug Mode Functionality
```bash
# Verify debug mode toggle
npm test -- --testNamePattern="setDebugMode"

# Expected: Debug mode state changes correctly
```

#### Test Diagnostic Report Generation  
```bash
# Verify diagnostic report creation
npm test -- --testNamePattern="getDiagnosticReport"

# Expected: Report contains system info, analysis stats, performance metrics
```

#### Test System Health Assessment
```bash
# Verify health scoring
npm test -- --testNamePattern="getSystemHealth"

# Expected: Health score calculated, issues identified, recommendations provided
```

### Factory Cache Validation

#### Test Cache Clearing
```bash
# Verify cache clearing functionality
npm test -- --testNamePattern="clearFactoryCache"

# Expected: Cache cleared, memory usage reduced
```

#### Test Analyzer Reset
```bash
# Verify analyzer reset functionality  
npm test -- --testNamePattern="resetFactoryAnalyzer"

# Expected: Analyzer instance reset, state cleaned up
```

#### Test Shared Analyzer Access
```bash
# Verify singleton behavior
npm test -- --testNamePattern="getFactoryAnalyzer"

# Expected: Consistent instance returned, proper state management
```

### Batch Processing Validation

#### Test Adaptive Concurrency
```bash
# Verify memory-based concurrency adjustment
npm test -- --testNamePattern="adaptive concurrency"

# Expected: Concurrency adjusted at 60%, 80%, 90%, 95% thresholds
```

#### Test Resource Monitoring
```bash
# Verify resource usage tracking
npm test -- --testNamePattern="resource monitoring"

# Expected: Accurate memory usage reporting, threshold detection
```

#### Test Garbage Collection Triggers
```bash
# Verify GC triggering at 90% memory usage
npm test -- --testNamePattern="garbage collection"

# Expected: GC triggered, memory usage reduced
```

### Directory Analysis Validation

#### Test Ignore Patterns
```bash
# Verify complex pattern matching
npm test -- --testNamePattern="ignore patterns"

# Expected: Patterns matched correctly, files filtered appropriately
```

#### Test Symlink Handling
```bash
# Verify symlink resolution and circular reference detection
npm test -- --testNamePattern="symlink"

# Expected: Symlinks resolved correctly, circular references detected
```

#### Test Error Recovery
```bash
# Verify error handling for directory operations
npm test -- --testNamePattern="directory error"

# Expected: Errors handled gracefully, appropriate fallbacks used
```

## Performance Validation

### Test Execution Performance
```bash
# Measure test execution times
npm test -- --verbose --testTimeout=10000

# Expected: All test files complete within performance targets
```

**Performance Targets**:
- diagnostic-methods.test.ts: <5 seconds
- factory-cache.test.ts: <3 seconds  
- batch-adaptive.test.ts: <8 seconds
- directory-edge-cases.test.ts: <6 seconds

### Memory Usage Validation
```bash
# Monitor memory usage during testing
npm test -- --logHeapUsage --detectOpenHandles

# Expected: No memory leaks, proper cleanup after tests
```

## Integration Testing

### Full Test Suite Execution
```bash
# Run complete test suite
npm test

# Expected: All existing tests continue to pass
# New tests integrate seamlessly with existing suite
```

### Coverage Integration
```bash
# Generate comprehensive coverage report
npm run test:coverage -- --coverageReporters=html

# Open coverage report in browser
open coverage/index.html

# Expected: Visual coverage improvements in HTML report
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Verify tests work in CI environment
npm run test -- --ci --coverage --watchAll=false

# Expected: Tests pass in CI mode, coverage meets thresholds
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Timeout Errors
```bash
# Increase timeout for resource-intensive tests
npm test -- --testTimeout=15000
```

#### Memory-Related Test Failures
```bash
# Run with increased heap size
node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/.bin/jest
```

#### Platform-Specific Path Issues
```bash
# Run tests with explicit platform settings
npm test -- --testPathPattern="directory-edge-cases" --verbose
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests in debug mode for detailed output
npm test -- --verbose --no-cache --testNamePattern="your-failing-test"
```

### Test Isolation
```bash
# Run individual test files in isolation
npm test -- --testPathPattern="diagnostic-methods" --runInBand
```
