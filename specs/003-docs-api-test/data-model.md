# Data Model: API Test Coverage Enhancement

## Overview
This document defines the data structures and entities involved in implementing comprehensive test coverage for previously untested API methods.

## Core Entities

### TestSuite
Represents a collection of related test cases organized by functionality.

**Attributes**:
- `name: string` - Descriptive name of the test suite
- `description: string` - Purpose and scope of the test suite  
- `testCases: TestCase[]` - Collection of individual test cases
- `executionTime: number` - Total execution time in milliseconds
- `status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'passed' | 'failed'` - Current execution status

**Validation Rules**:
- Name must be non-empty and descriptive
- Test cases must be non-empty array
- Execution time must be positive number

**State Transitions**:
- pending → running (test execution starts)
- running → passed (all test cases pass)
- running → failed (any test case fails)

### TestCase  
Represents an individual test scenario within a test suite.

**Attributes**:
- `id: string` - Unique identifier for the test case
- `name: string` - Descriptive name of what is being tested
- `methodName: string` - API method being tested
- `scenario: TestScenario` - The specific test scenario details
- `expectedResult: any` - Expected outcome of the test
- `actualResult?: any` - Actual result after execution  
- `status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'passed' | 'failed'` - Test execution status
- `executionTime?: number` - Time taken to execute in milliseconds
- `errorMessage?: string` - Error details if test fails

**Validation Rules**:
- ID must be unique within test suite
- Method name must match actual API method
- Expected result must be defined
- Error message required if status is 'failed'

### TestScenario
Defines the specific conditions and inputs for a test case.

**Attributes**:
- `type: 'unit' | 'integration' | 'edge-case' | 'performance'` - Category of test
- `inputs: Record<string, any>` - Input parameters for the test
- `preconditions: string[]` - Required setup conditions
- `postconditions: string[]` - Expected state after test
- `mockRequirements: MockRequirement[]` - Any mocking needed

**Validation Rules**:
- Type must be one of defined categories
- Inputs must include all required parameters for method
- Preconditions must be verifiable
- Postconditions must be measurable

### MockRequirement
Specifies mocking requirements for tests that need controlled environments.

**Attributes**:
- `target: string` - What needs to be mocked (method, module, resource)
- `mockType: 'return-value' | 'implementation' | 'property' | 'resource-state'` - Type of mock
- `mockValue: any` - The mocked return value or implementation
- `condition?: string` - When this mock should apply

**Validation Rules**:
- Target must be a valid mockable entity
- Mock type must match target type
- Mock value must be compatible with expected interface

### CoverageMetric
Represents test coverage measurements and tracking.

**Attributes**:
- `methodName: string` - API method being measured
- `currentCoverage: number` - Current coverage percentage (0-100)
- `targetCoverage: number` - Desired coverage percentage
- `testCount: number` - Number of tests covering this method
- `lastUpdated: Date` - When coverage was last measured
- `riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'` - Risk assessment based on coverage

**Validation Rules**:
- Coverage percentages must be between 0-100
- Test count must be non-negative integer
- Risk level calculated based on coverage and method criticality

### ResourceMonitoringScenario
Defines scenarios for testing resource management and adaptive behaviors.

**Attributes**:
- `memoryUsagePercent: number` - Simulated memory usage percentage
- `concurrencyLevel: number` - Current concurrency setting
- `expectedBehavior: ResourceBehavior` - Expected system response
- `actualBehavior?: ResourceBehavior` - Observed system behavior
- `thresholdType: '60%' | '80%' | '90%' | '95%'` - Which threshold is being tested

**Validation Rules**:
- Memory usage percent must be between 0-100
- Concurrency level must be positive integer
- Threshold type must match actual system thresholds

### ResourceBehavior
Represents expected or actual system behavior under resource constraints.

**Attributes**:
- `concurrencyAdjustment?: number` - Change in concurrency level
- `gcTriggered?: boolean` - Whether garbage collection was triggered
- `errorThrown?: boolean` - Whether resource error was thrown
- `processingStopped?: boolean` - Whether processing was stopped early
- `responseTime: number` - Time taken to respond to resource condition

## Entity Relationships

### TestSuite → TestCase (1:Many)
- Each test suite contains multiple test cases
- Test cases are executed as part of their parent suite
- Suite status depends on aggregate test case results

### TestCase → TestScenario (1:1)  
- Each test case has exactly one scenario defining its conditions
- Scenarios are reusable across test cases
- Scenario type determines execution approach

### TestCase → CoverageMetric (Many:1)
- Multiple test cases may contribute to coverage of single method
- Coverage metrics aggregate results from all related test cases
- Method coverage improves as more test cases are added

### TestScenario → MockRequirement (1:Many)
- Complex scenarios may require multiple mocks
- Mock requirements are applied before test execution
- Mocks are cleaned up after test completion

### ResourceMonitoringScenario → ResourceBehavior (1:1)
- Each monitoring scenario has expected behavior
- Actual behavior is recorded during test execution
- Comparison determines test pass/fail status

## Data Flow

### Test Execution Flow
1. **TestSuite** loads collection of **TestCase** entities
2. Each **TestCase** applies its **TestScenario** configuration
3. **MockRequirement** entities are applied for controlled testing
4. Test execution produces results that update **TestCase** status
5. **CoverageMetric** entities are updated based on execution results
6. **ResourceMonitoringScenario** tests update **ResourceBehavior** data

### Coverage Tracking Flow  
1. **CoverageMetric** entities track current state for each method
2. New **TestCase** execution increments coverage
3. Risk levels are recalculated based on coverage improvements
4. Overall project coverage metrics are aggregated

### Resource Testing Flow
1. **ResourceMonitoringScenario** defines test conditions
2. System resource state is simulated or controlled
3. **ResourceBehavior** captures system response
4. Expected vs actual behavior comparison determines test result

## Persistence Strategy
- **In-Memory**: Test execution data (TestCase results, ResourceBehavior)
- **File System**: Test definitions (TestSuite, TestScenario, MockRequirement)
- **Jest Reports**: Coverage metrics and test results
- **No Database**: All data is transient or file-based for simplicity

## Validation Strategy
- **Schema Validation**: TypeScript interfaces enforce structure
- **Runtime Validation**: Jest assertions validate expected outcomes  
- **Business Rules**: Custom validators for complex relationships
- **Coverage Validation**: Jest coverage reports validate metric accuracy
