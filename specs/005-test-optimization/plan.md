# Implementation Plan: Test Case Optimization

**Branch**: `005-test-optimization` | **Date**: 2025-01-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-test-optimization/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   ✅ Feature spec loaded - test case optimization for improved maintainability and performance
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   ✅ Project type: single TypeScript library with Jest testing framework
   ✅ Structure Decision: Option 1 (single project) - existing test structure optimization
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ✅ Research complete - test structure analyzed, optimization patterns identified
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
   ✅ Phase 1 complete - data model defined, contracts created, quickstart guide written, CLAUDE.md updated
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   ✅ No new constitutional violations - design aligns with TDD principles
   ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   ✅ Task generation approach planned - ready for /tasks command
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Optimize the existing test suite to reduce execution time, remove redundancy, and improve maintainability while preserving critical test coverage. Technical approach focuses on test categorization, consolidation of duplicates, and shifting from implementation-focused to behavior-focused testing.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Jest (testing framework), tree-sitter (AST parsing), tree-sitter-typescript
**Storage**: N/A - Test optimization project, no storage layer
**Testing**: Jest with ts-jest transformer, existing test infrastructure
**Target Platform**: Node.js library development environment
**Project Type**: single - TypeScript library with comprehensive test suite
**Performance Goals**: Reduce test execution time by 50% (from 3+ seconds to <1.5 seconds) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact target?]
**Constraints**: Maintain minimum 80% code coverage [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact coverage threshold?], preserve all API contract tests
**Scale/Scope**: 309 total tests (22 failing), aiming to consolidate to ~200-250 optimized tests

## Constitution Check

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project structure, optimizing existing test hierarchy

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Completed** ✅:
- Current test infrastructure analysis (309 tests, 3.17s execution time)
- Test categorization strategy (Critical/Optimize/Remove tiers)
- Optimization patterns identification (shared utilities, behavior-driven focus)
- Performance baselines established (23 failed tests, 5 failed suites)
- Framework integration requirements documented

**Key Findings**:
- Parser registration issues causing duplicate warnings
- Worker cleanup problems affecting CI stability
- Clear optimization opportunities in test consolidation
- Need for behavior-focused testing over implementation testing

**Output**: research.md with comprehensive analysis and optimization strategy

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete ✅*

**Phase 1 Completed** ✅:

**Artifacts Created**:
1. **data-model.md** - Comprehensive data model for test optimization:
   - TestSuite, TestCase, OptimizationOpportunity entities
   - CategorizedTests and PerformanceBaseline structures
   - Entity relationships and validation rules

2. **API Contracts** in `/contracts/` directory:
   - `test-optimization.contract.ts` - Core optimization interfaces and behaviors
   - `test-utilities.contract.ts` - Shared utilities and helpers contracts

3. **quickstart.md** - Comprehensive validation guide:
   - 2-minute quick validation procedure
   - 15-minute comprehensive validation
   - Troubleshooting guide and success metrics

4. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated project context:
   - Current test optimization status
   - Performance targets and technical focus
   - Integration with existing project knowledge

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load design artifacts: data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
- Generate implementation tasks based on contract specifications
- Each contract interface → test implementation task [P]
- Each optimization opportunity → implementation task
- Each utility component → development task [P]
- Validation tasks derived from quickstart scenarios

**Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation Tasks** - Shared utilities and test infrastructure
2. **Analysis Tasks** - Test suite analysis and categorization
3. **Optimization Tasks** - Test consolidation and improvement
4. **Validation Tasks** - Performance and coverage verification
5. **Integration Tasks** - CI/CD integration and monitoring

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Utilities → Analysis → Optimization → Validation
- Risk order: Low-risk optimizations before high-risk changes
- Parallel execution: Mark independent components with [P]

**Estimated Task Count**: 22-28 tasks organized as:
- 5 foundation tasks (utilities, setup) [P]
- 6 analysis tasks (categorization, identification) [P]
- 8 optimization tasks (consolidation, removal, enhancement)
- 5 validation tasks (performance, coverage, reliability)
- 3 integration tasks (CI/CD, monitoring, documentation)

**Quality Gates**: Each task includes:
- RED phase: Contract test must fail initially
- GREEN phase: Implementation makes contract test pass
- REFACTOR phase: Optimize and improve maintainability
- VALIDATION: Meets performance and quality criteria

**Risk Management**:
- Low risk tasks can be executed in parallel
- Medium risk tasks require sequential validation
- High risk tasks need backup and rollback procedures
- All critical path tests must be preserved

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
