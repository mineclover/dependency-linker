# Tasks: Test Case Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-test-optimization/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.0+, Jest, tree-sitter
   → Structure: Single project optimization
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: TestSuite, TestCase, OptimizationOpportunity entities ✅
   → contracts/: test-optimization.contract.ts, test-utilities.contract.ts ✅
   → research.md: Current state analysis, optimization strategy ✅
   → quickstart.md: Validation scenarios and success criteria ✅
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Test infrastructure, measurement tools
   → Tests: Contract tests, validation tests
   → Core: Analysis engine, optimization engine, utilities
   → Integration: Performance tracking, CI integration
   → Polish: Validation, documentation, metrics
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T040)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness ✅
9. Return: SUCCESS (40 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

**Test Dependencies (TDD)**:
- T006-T016 (all contract/integration tests) before T017-T027 (implementation)

**Model Dependencies**:
- T017-T020 (models) must complete before T021-T023 (services using models)

**Service Dependencies**:
- T021 (TestAnalyzer) blocks T022 (TestOptimizer) - analyzer provides input
- T023 (PerformanceTracker) blocks T034-T037 (performance validation)

**Integration Dependencies**:
- T024-T027 (utilities) before T028-T029 (CLI commands using utilities)
- T021-T023 (core services) before T028-T029 (CLI commands)
- T030-T033 (helper infrastructure) before validation (T034-T037)

**Validation Dependencies**:
- All implementation (T017-T033) before validation (T034-T037)
- T034-T037 (validation) before final polish (T038-T040)

## Task Validation Rules

### RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Validation
Each implementation task must:
1. **RED**: Run corresponding contract/integration test - must FAIL
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal solution to make test PASS
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests GREEN

### Performance Validation
- T005 baseline measurement must be completed before any optimization tasks
- T016 performance validation must confirm <1.5s execution time target
- T023 PerformanceTracker must validate all optimization claims

### Coverage Validation
- All contract tests (T006-T012) must achieve 100% interface coverage
- Integration tests (T013-T016) must maintain ≥80% overall coverage
- No regression in API contract test coverage allowed

### Quality Gates
- Each task completion requires passing linting and type checking
- No worker exit issues allowed after T004 Jest configuration
- Parser registration warnings must be eliminated by T024 TestSetupManager

## Risk Management

### Low Risk (Parallel Execution Safe)
- Foundation tasks (T001-T003, T005)
- Contract tests (T006-T012)
- Data models (T017-T020)
- Utility services (T024-T027)

### Medium Risk (Sequential Validation Needed)
- Jest configuration changes (T004)
- Integration tests (T013-T016) - may affect shared test state
- Core services (T021-T023) - interdependent implementations

### High Risk (Backup Required)
- T022 TestOptimizer - modifies existing test files
- T028 CLI command - user-facing interface changes

### Rollback Procedures
For each high-risk task:
1. Create git branch before starting
2. Backup current test files
3. Implement with dry-run mode first
4. Validate with T016 performance test before committing

## Success Criteria

### Performance Targets (from quickstart.md)
- **Execution Time**: <1.5 seconds (from 3.17s baseline)
- **Test Count**: ~250 tests (from 309 baseline, 20% reduction)
- **Pass Rate**: >99% (from 92.6% baseline)
- **Coverage**: ≥80% maintained

### Quality Targets
- **Flaky Tests**: Eliminated (0% failure rate)
- **Worker Issues**: Resolved (no exit problems)
- **Parser Warnings**: Eliminated (no duplicate registrations)
- **Maintainability**: Improved through shared utilities

### Validation Gates
1. All contract tests must fail initially (T006-T012)
2. All integration tests must fail initially (T013-T016)
3. Implementation makes tests pass (T017-T033)
4. Performance validation confirms targets (T034-T037)
5. Final optimization meets all success criteria

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - test-optimization.contract.ts → T006-T008 (ITestAnalyzer, ITestOptimizer, IPerformanceTracker)
   - test-utilities.contract.ts → T009-T012 (ITestSetupManager, ITestDataFactory, ITestAssertions, ITestBenchmark)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - TestSuite → T017, TestCase → T018, OptimizationOpportunity → T019, PerformanceBaseline → T020

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Performance validation → T034-T037
   - Integration workflows → T013-T016

4. **Ordering Applied**:
   - Setup (T001-T005) → Tests (T006-T016) → Models (T017-T020) → Services (T021-T023) → Utilities (T024-T027) → CLI (T028-T029) → Infrastructure (T030-T033) → Validation (T034-T037) → Polish (T038-T040)

## Validation Checklist ✅

- [✅] All contracts have corresponding tests (T006-T012)
- [✅] All entities have model tasks (T017-T020)
- [✅] All tests come before implementation (T006-T016 before T017-T033)
- [✅] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared state)
- [✅] Each task specifies exact file path
- [✅] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [✅] TDD workflow enforced (failing tests before implementation)
- [✅] Performance targets clearly defined
- [✅] Success criteria measurable

**Ready for Execution**: All 40 tasks are defined with clear deliverables, dependencies, and validation criteria. Follow TDD principles strictly - no implementation without failing tests first.
