## 🎓 Clean Architecture Principles Applied

1. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
   - Both depend on abstractions (interfaces)

2. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class has one reason to change
   - Clear, focused responsibilities

3. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Interface-based extensibility

4. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Derived classes substitutable for base classes
   - Consistent behavior across implementations

5. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Many specific interfaces over general ones
   - Clients not forced to depend on unused methods

## 🔄 Migration Path

For teams adopting this architecture:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one service or module
2. **Extract Domain**: Identify and isolate business logic
3. **Define Interfaces**: Create contracts before implementations
4. **Inject Dependencies**: Use constructor injection
5. **Add Tests**: Test each layer independently
6. **Iterate**: Gradually expand to other modules
